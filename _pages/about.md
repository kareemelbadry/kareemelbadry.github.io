I'm an astrophysicist at the [Institute for Theory and Computation](https://itc.cfa.harvard.edu/) in the [Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) and a Junior Fellow in the Harvard [Society of Fellows](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/about). I also hold a recurring appointment at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) in Heidelberg. In August 2023, I will move to [Caltech](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/) as an assistant professor. 

My research is focused on binary stars. I use a combination of large-scale surveys, targeted observations of individual objects, and theoretical stellar evolution calculations to better understand how binaries form, evolve, and interact with their surroundings. I am also interested in Milky Way stellar populations, galaxy formation, and statistical astronomy.  Most generally, I like exploring astronomical datasets, learning new things, and developing methods to extract information from data. I have been called [the "black hole destroyer"](https://www.cnet.com/science/space/black-hole-destroyers-just-found-a-strange-black-hole-lurking-in-deep-space/) but [am](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.1057E/abstract) [working](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230207880E/abstract) to make my net black hole count positive.  


I grew up in Roseburg, Oregon. I was an undergraduate at [Yale University](https://astronomy.yale.edu/) (B.S., astrophysics, 2016) and a graduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) (Ph.D., astrophysics, 2021). I moved to Harvard in 2021. Besides astronomy, I like food, running, hiking and cycling, playing chess, and memes.

I am happy to talk anytime with Harvard grads and undergrads -- or current and prospective Caltech students and postdocs -- interested in working on a research project.
