I'm an Assistant Professor of Astronomy at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/). I am interested in [binary stars](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.2269E/abstract), [black holes](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.1057E/abstract), and related [stellar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.3436E/abstract) [exotica](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230603914E/abstract). My group uses a combination of large-scale surveys, targeted observations of individual objects, and theoretical stellar evolution calculations to better understand how these objects form, evolve, and interact with their surroundings. I am also interested in Milky Way stellar populations, galaxy formation, and statistical astronomy.  Most generally, I like exploring astronomical datasets, learning new things, and developing methods to extract information from data. I have been called [the "black hole destroyer"](https://www.cnet.com/science/space/black-hole-destroyers-just-found-a-strange-black-hole-lurking-in-deep-space/) but [am](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.1057E/abstract) [working](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230207880E/abstract) to make my net black hole count positive.  
 

I grew up in Roseburg, Oregon. I was an undergraduate at [Yale University](https://astronomy.yale.edu/) (B.S., astrophysics, 2016), a graduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) (Ph.D., astrophysics, 2021), and a postdoc at the [Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) (Junior Fellow, 2021-2023). I moved to Caltech in 2023. I also hold a recurring visitor appointment at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) in Heidelberg. Besides astronomy, I like food, running, hiking and cycling, playing chess, and memes.

I am happy to talk anytime with current and prospective Caltech students and postdocs interested in working on a research project.
