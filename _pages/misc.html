<h2>On publishing</h2> 
I don't think scientists should have to pay to publish their work and am a big supporter of <a href="https://astro.theoj.org/">The Open Journal of Astrophysics</a>, where I have recently focused much of my refereeing and publishing. Feel free to contact me if you are curious about this publishing model.

If you are in town or we are at a conference together, I'd love to join you for a run!
