<h2>Note on publishing</h2> 
I don't think scientists should have to pay to publish their work and am a big supporter of [The Open Journal of Astrophysics](https://astro.theoj.org/), where I have recently focused much of my refereeing and publishing. Feel free to contact me if you are curious about this publishing model.
