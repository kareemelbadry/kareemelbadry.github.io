I get emails almost every day from students looking for summer research projects, PhD positions, postdoc positions, guided independent study, etc. I usually cannot respond to these questions individually - I wish I could, but I already spend too much time writing emails! Below is some information in response to the most common questions I receive. 


<h2>For prospective summer students</h2> 
Every summer, Caltech hosts several hundred undergraduates -- including both Caltech students and students from other universities -- through the  <a href="https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf">SURF</a> program. Applications are usually due in February. If I or students and postdocs in my group are able to host SURF students in a given year, we will post an announcement of opportunity on the SURF page. If you don't see anything posted, we do not currently have positions available. 
 

<h2>For prospective PhD students</h2> 
Information about the Caltech graduate program is available <a href="https://www.astro.caltech.edu/academics/graduate-program">here</a>. In general, students are admitted to the program as a whole, not to any individual faculty member's group. I am open to the possibility of taking on a new student in the cohort that will enroll in Fall 2026. If you would like to work with my group, please review some of our recent <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20%20author%3A%22el-badry%2C%20k%22%20year%3A2015-2030&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">work</a> and indicate your interest in your personal statement. I will be happy to discuss specific opportunities if you are admitted to the program.

<h2>For prospective postdocs</h2> 
Here are the best ways to come to Caltech as a postdoc:<br>

For theory-oriented people: <a href="https://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/postdoctoral-fellowships"> Burke Fellowship</a>. <br>

For instrumentation-oriented people:  <a href="https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/fellowship/30372"> EXP Fellowship</a>. <br>


For survey-oriented people: <a href="https://aas.org/jobregister/ad/d9935371">Time-Domain Fellowship</a>. <br>


For observation-oriented people: <a href="https://aas.org/jobregister/ad/47b65fb9">Carnegie-Caltech Brinson Fellowship
</a> (not offered in 2025-2026). <br>

For anyone: apply to a national fellowship (e.g. NHFP, NSF, 51 Peg, etc.) with Caltech as your host institute. If you are interested in this and would collaborate with me as a postdoc, I'm happy to chat as you develop your proposal.
